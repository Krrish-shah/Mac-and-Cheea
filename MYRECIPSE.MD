1. Take 1 cup macaroni pasta or elbow macaroni (100 grams or 3.5 ounces)
2. Cook the pasta as per the instructions on the package. I first heated 4 cups water, plus ½ teaspoon salt to a vigorous boil and then added the pasta.
3. Cook the pasta until it is al dente or just cooked. It should not get too soft or mushy or break.
4. Drain the pasta in a colander or strainer.
5. While the pasta is cooking, grease a baking pan with some softened butter.
6. Then in a microwave safe bowl, melt 1 teaspoon butter.
7. Now add ⅓ cup breadcrumbs to the melted butter. If you do not have store-bought breadcrumbs, you can easily make your own. Simply take 3 to 4 slices of bread that are 2 to 3 days old, tear them apart and grind them in a dry grinder or mixer.
